Although many families have purchased dogs or cats during the long months of the pandemic, my family opted to buy a bird since we thought it would be less work than caring for other pets. We thought wrong. 

To begin, my bird, a green cheek conure named Chief Keef, requires constant attention. If I leave him in a room and begin to walk away, he darts onto my shoulder, following me wherever I go, even if I am too busy to care for him. Sometimes when Iâ€™m with him, he grabs my finger with his foot and starts biting it, asking me to rub his head. He does not let go until he is satisfied with his head rub. Chief Keef might be just about the most spoiled bird in the world. 

Whenever I try to send him back to his cage, he refuses to dismount my finger and instead climbs onto my shoulder. The only way I can lock him into his cage is if I threaten to grab him with a towel, which instantly makes him obedient for some odd reason. When he is successfully locked into a cage (typically by my mom), he begins to cry for freedom 10 minutes later. 

When we eat, we have to keep him locked up because we learned the hard way how much havoc he wreaks when we let him watch us from the top of his cage. He often tries to lean off of my shoulder and steal my food as I am trying to take a bite. He also tries jumping onto the dinner table and stealing food straight from my bowl. He especially loves trying to steal noodles because they resemble worms, though for some reason he destroys his stolen noodle with his beak instead of eating it. 

He finds himself dissatisfied with all the toys that are given to him, and instead likes to play with things that are not his. For him, playing with things means destroying them with his beak. This little but destructive animal has chewed through my mouse pad, my mouse wire, my charging cable and countless pens. He even managed to remove my kitchen window from his constant chewing. My parents gave him various toys to chew through, but he never uses them since, of course, they belong to him. 

While my bird can be a terror in the house, it is quite helpless against other animals because of its size. Falcons, cats, and crows are willing to prey on him. Whenever he encounters a predator, he flaps his wings around, trying to run away. Unfortunately, his wings are clipped because my family does not want him escaping, though we do take him out on walks, like a dog. Therefore, escaping a predator would be difficult for him.

Even worse, he is quite stupid. Instead of looking for a human to protect him, he helplessly tries running away. Luckily, during most incidents when he is being hunted, he is inside the house, standing by a window. However, there is a neighborhood cat that has been lurking near my house, likely looking for Chief Keef.
