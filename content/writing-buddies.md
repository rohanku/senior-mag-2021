“You know when something you write looks good on paper but when you read it aloud it becomes flaming trash?”

“Yeah, and then when you go back to fix stuff, you feel like you’ve never felt such emotional connection to one sentence.”

Looking back at 12 years of knowing each other, we realized the crux of our friendship has always hinged on our mutual need to write.

We met during first grade on the playground at Foothill Elementary, back when making friends was as simple as asking someone if you could “play with them.”

There are countless stories to tell about our earliest year of friendship, but our bond really began to cement in second grade, when we started reading Daisy Meadows’ iconic fairy book series “Rainbow Magic” and thought so highly of the text that we thought, “Why don’t we flagrantly rip this off?”

This kicked off our years-long campaign pretending the playground was Fairyland and our friend group the heroes saving it from the clutches of Jack Frost. Eventually, we decided our shenanigans were good enough to transcribe into full-blown stories. 

Our first finished, illustrated collaborative work was a horror fiction called “A Stupid Ghost Story,” written in fourth grade, when we still held ourselves up to the gold standard of toilet humor. Our hand-drawn cover had a ghost with a mustache on it, and the opening line read, “It was a dark and stormy night, and Samantha went to Mattress Discounters.” Eat your heart out, Stephen King.

Our inane sense of humor continued into middle school, where we and our friend group wrote the “Billthore Storytime” saga, an epic about Billthore, a tree who cheats on his wife, dies in a car accident and battles his ex-wife for a rite to heaven.

In seventh grade, we crowned ourselves monarchs of everything “writing” — not necessarily because we thought we had talent in that area, but because we were so in love with stories.

We were two shameless, inseparable dweebs obsessed with our own fiction, who also happened to be absolute writing powerhouses at the time. Unfortunately, sometimes (most of the time) a passion for writing doesn’t necessarily translate into quality prose. Still, the Bay Area pressure to be good at everything hadn’t sunk in yet, and nothing deterred us from carrying pens and notebooks everywhere we went.

A typical BFF sleepover with us had only one thing on the agenda: sitting side by side glued to computer screens knocking out story after story after story into the wee hours of 11:30 p.m. 

On one memorable night, we timed ourselves to individually write short stories based on superlatives for our characters, with prompts like “most likely to go down the stairs in a laundry basket” or “most likely to steal a kid’s ice cream” — neither of which we ourselves had the guts to do. 

We additionally started writing three collaborative novels. “Loa’s Home” was a Kafkaesque tale about fruitlessly trying to escape humanity to live in the sky. As we wrote “Finding My True Romance,” an insufferable parody of cheesy teen novels, we learned that “Twilight” could indeed be topped by two blundering 14-year-olds with the romantic experiences of a bag of hair. 

But our favorite joint masterpiece remains “The Vast Rooms,” a wholly self-indulgent bacchanal of a story in which we threw all of our favorite original characters in a locked room and made them sass each other to no end. To this day, our identities as writers are profoundly affected by that story, and we still occasionally visit the “Vast Rooms” document to read memorable lines like “She looks like a homeless Polly Pocket” or “I’d rather culture myself with the occult.”

Since those days, we’ve both spent time polishing our writing separately. High school inevitably drove a wedge in those coveted middle school writing sessions of unadulterated creativity, with late-night character deep dives replaced with frantically finishing newspaper articles or trying to pull together coherent analyses of “Hamlet.”

When we actually had the time to write for pleasure, we would often instead text each other paragraphs lamenting our writer’s block, our unabashed love for em dashes or jokes about how we know nothing about the most basic of writing concepts. (Plot structure? Character development? Please introduce us.)

Looking back on our shared Google Docs from middle school, our amateur writing styles and dialogues, we cringe. Still, there’s a bit of esoteric charm left in those words. We marvel at how many pages of writing we used to have been able to churn out in one night, back when we were completely unhinged and unperturbed by the now constantly growing fear of failure. We do, in no small part, owe it to each other how much we’ve both grown as creative people.

  A recurring conversation that we have is about our future dual midlife crisis, where we swear we’ll both, amidst whatever adult responsibilities we might have, crack open our old Google Drive folder and spend hours doubling over in laughter, reminiscing on those stories that invariably left a more lasting mark on us than we probably ever cared to consider as bright-eyed, dorky preteens.  

“Writing buddies for life”: That’s no joke. We’re putting that in each other’s eulogies.
