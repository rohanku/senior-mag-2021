###Surgical mask

-   Honestly probably the smartest out of your friends

-   Their mom gets them for free at the hospital she works at

-   Not burden by the pressures of *high* fashion (let’s be real
though, those people always look good <3)

###Handmade mask from your mom

-   The one in your friend group who dresses up for every holiday

-   Remembers everybody’s birthday, and will bake you a cake to
celebrate

-   Too nice to not wear it (even though it has gaps, like,
everywhere)

     style="margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: -10px; max-height: 300px" />
###Commercial cloth mask

-   Compulsive need to have matching clothing

-   Probably owns about 10 pairs of novelty socks

-   The one who always gets stuck washing the dishes at home

     style="margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: -10px; max-height: 300px" />
###Neck gaiter

-   Knows the difference between a cabariall flip and 540 flip

-   Always out “sick” when there’s good snow in Tahoe

-   Probably decent at navigation

     alt="N95"
     style="margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: -10px; max-height: 300px" />
###N95

-   Never actually goes in the pool when swimming

-   High pain tolerance

-   Wants to align themselves with the local goose population
