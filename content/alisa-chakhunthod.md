As she turned off the engine of the c-152 plane, Alisa Chankhunthod steeled herself to plummet toward the ground 13,000 feet below. She knew that practicing stalls — preparing for a free-falling plane — was an important part of being a pilot and ready in case a plane malfunctioned, even if they were extremely difficult and scary. 

To prevent the plane from spiraling out of control, Alisa pointed the nose of the plane up and guided it safely using directed air pressure on the wings. 

“The first time I did [stalls], it was absolutely terrifying, and in that moment I thought maybe I don’t want to learn how to fly,”  Alisa said. “However, now that I know how to do them correctly, I find them quite fun.” 

Alisa is now a single engine rated pilot, but she has yet to receive her commercial license. 

 She began flying in her freshman year. She said that she learned how to fly in part because her father is a chief flying instructor at Advantage Aviation in Palo Alto, and she wanted to know what it was like to fly a plane. Now, Alisa uses the unique skill for community service and for fun.

Alisa employs her flight skills at the nonprofit Pilots N Paws, where she rescues dogs, usually from Los Angeles, that are about to be put down and brings them to locations that can take better care of them or better rehabilitate them for foster homes or adoption. She helps at the nonprofit in other ways, including working reception on the weekend, helping pilots and cleaning up the flying club. 

When she is not flying for the nonprofit, Alisa also flies for her own pleasure. She is cleared to fly solo, but she cannot fly passengers yet.

Alisa’s path to flight was demanding, but her father aided her greatly in her journey; he taught her how to fly while they were up in the air. She said that since planes have two yokes (wheels), her father either guided her with the second yoke while she flew with one or let her fly alone while he advised her. Alisa said she did not have to go through any training or ground school, as pilots typically do, and she stepped into a plane on her first day. 

Even among the many demanding skills like stalls, Alisa said that the toughest part of flying is controlling the radio. 

“I tend to get a little nervous in my communication and forget the correct order of things,” Alisa said. 

The skill has continued to pay off as she defies gravity. Chankhunthod said that she still recalls the first time she took off and the feeling of power that came with it. 

After four years of experiencing the ups and downs of flying, Alisa still finds it to be an exhilarating experience. 

“The moment I felt the plane leave the ground by just the gentle pull of the yoke, I felt incredible,” Alisa said. “To be able to leave the earth so easily while we usually are detained by gravity is an amazing feeling!”
