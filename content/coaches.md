When we walked onto the court, field, pool deck and track as lanky freshmen, we were focused on getting through the first day of tryouts. Looking up at the taller, faster seniors, we couldn’t fathom that we, too, would grow stronger, more skilled and importantly, more mature under your guidance.

Track coach Archie Ljepava endowed us with silly nicknames we wore as badges of honor, we endured games and races we’d rather forget and we bonded with teammates over jokes muttered during warm-ups and groans elicited by plenty of liners. But more important than lay-up drills or tips on achieving perfect form, we learned how to handle ourselves in pressure situations. Coaches like Mike Davey (softball),  Danny Wallace (girls’ basketball), Tim Lugo (football) and Patrick Judge (known as PJ to his boys’ basketball team) modeled leadership in the most competitive end-of-game situations, and the fortitude you built in us is a lasting trait we hope to take with us.

Thank you for patiently shaping us into good teammates, leaders and people. Recalling our rambunctious freshman selves, we know it was no small feat. Yet each practice inspired new courage to take on challenges in the classroom and beyond because, heck, they couldn’t be harder than sprinting coach Rick Ellis’s pyramid workout.

It’s true, we might have been — or still are — a little scared of you, but during car rides talking about difficult classes, relationships and injuries, we admit you offered sound advice. We even wish we took it. 

We discovered a helpless Coach Archie would try anything to stop our tears, but also that he would join us in our proudest moments. And even in a global pandemic, Coach PJ’s dedication to team unity kept the boys in shape, reporting to the group chat. Tennis coach coach Yuko Aoki would appear on our Zoom screens, faithfully executing the infamous senior P.E. experience with the same powerhouse voice.

Coaches who doubled as teachers became mentors, too, pushing us to our limits in the water and in APES and bringing jokes and nicknames from the court into the classroom, bewildering our classmates. 

We will remember the late water polo coach Jerome Chung, who died unexpectedly at age 37 this past spring,  for his wit and dedication to helping players grow up and persevere through grueling seasons.

Coaches helped us bond with one another, not just because misery loves company, but because you encouraged us to be honest with one another, help each other and pick our teammates up when they were down. Following your example, we became better athletes, friends and students.

So while you may say the bricks on our feet in the last 100 meters of the race are in our heads, you’ll grant that the pangs in our hearts are real, knowing it’s our last season with your level-headed guidance.
