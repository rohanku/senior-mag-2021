When Elyse Hulme’s family gets together, she feels like the “ninth wheel.” Among her parents, two married siblings and coupled-up sister, it’s hard to forget she’s the kid of the family.

At 18, Elyse is 11 years younger than her oldest sibling, Allison, who is 29. Her brother Christopher is 26, and her sister Hannah is 23. Despite their age differences and the fact that Elyse has been the only kid at home since seventh grade, the four Hulme siblings have great relationships. 

“It's definitely weird to just be at home with my parents all the time, but it makes it more fun to see my siblings,” Elyse said. “Part of the reason we all have such a good relationship is because of the age gaps. Since I don't see them that often, I’ve never really fought with my siblings.”

Another perk of having three siblings go through Saratoga schools before her is what Elyse jokingly called the “Hulme Legacy.” 

When they see her last name on the roster, Elyse’s new teachers frequently mention they taught her cousins or siblings or inquire about a relationship. In some cases, she said she deliberately introduces herself with her full name if she knows it will be familiar.

“All my life basically, all the teachers who have had my siblings already know me, which is kind of nice because they usually like my siblings,” Elyse said. “So then they kind of automatically like me, but I do have to keep up the reputation for future Hulmes.”

While those future Hulmes may not be her siblings, Elyse has cousins to think about, too — 45 first cousins, to be exact, including freshman Paul Hulme, sophomore Seth Hulme, junior Johnny Hulme and senior Shawn Hulme. Since Elyse’s grandpa’s brothers came to the South Bay in the 1950s and her grandpa arrived in 1961, much of the Hulme clan also settled in the South Bay and attended schools like Saratoga and Lynbrook High. Now, Elyse’s grandpa and his surviving brother live in Saratoga.

In part because of their proximity to one another, Elyse said the Hulmes are all “homies.” Occasionally, she encounters a Hulme she’s never heard of before, who she suspects are her second cousins. 

“There are my grandpa's descendants, and then there’s a huge web of Hulmes beyond that that I'm not even aware of,” Elyse said. “Sometimes my dad will be talking about his cousins, and I'll be like, ‘Wait, how are they related? Who are these people?’ It's interesting to figure it out but also very confusing sometimes.”

Because all of her grandpa’s descendants are Mormon, the family’s shared faith and weekly attendance to the same church brings them together. 

“We're all into the church, so that definitely does keep us tight because we all believe the same things,” Elyse said.

While Elyse never felt pressure from her family to follow in her siblings' footsteps, she said her family's close nature motivates her to do well. She said she’s not rebellious, but she bears in mind that a bad act would not only disappoint her parents and siblings but also her aunts, uncles and grandparents — while setting a bad example for her younger cousins.

Looking back on high school, Elyse said she’s proud of the range of sports she participated in — volleyball, soccer, track and cross country. Although she and all of her siblings did ceramics in high school, Elyse said her variety of sports made her unique from her siblings.

After graduation, Elyse plans to attend BYU Idaho, where she’ll be “in 25 degrees and snow up to my knees.” Despite the departure from the town and house she has lived in for her whole life, she said she’s ready for the change.

“I’m just so familiar with everything here that it will be kind of hard to be somewhere new where I know nobody,” Elyse said. “It'll be interesting to go somewhere where I don't know anyone and I don't know anything about the place, but I'm excited also to move on.”
