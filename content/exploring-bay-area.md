Saratoga was always the tiny suburban town that we wanted to leave for bigger, more exciting places. The goal of high school was to “grind it out” in the hopes of getting into a college far from home, and we always looked forward to our second semester of senior year when, free from the burden of college apps, we could travel around with friends. 

But then the pandemic hit, and we’ve all had to stay close to home. 

At first, the idea of being cooped up in Saratoga felt a bit suffocating. But we decided to make the most of the situation, and as it turns out, there’s actually some pretty cool stuff to do around here! 

###Living the bella vita at Montalvo

We first went to do a photoshoot around the grounds in March, but since discovering how lovely Montalvo is, it’s become a prime hangout spot for our friends. 

When we drove into Montalvo, we felt like we had been transported out of the U.S. and into Italy. It’s one of the safest, most peaceful and most beautiful places we’ve ever been. 

Villa Montalvo, the 1912 giant Mediterranean style mansion in the front, is covered in wisteria and ivy and has a small courtyard in the back. The white paint and architectural lines make it a classy background for photos, too, so if you want a new headshot for LinkedIn, it’s a great place to go.

The giant front lawn is the perfect place to play frisbee,  have a picnic, or just relax and read. Most of the people who go to Montalvo are young families with their little toddlers, and often we’re the only teenagers there — which to us, just makes the whole experience that much more relaxing. (Also, not to sound creepy, but it’s very entertaining to watch little kids and the shenanigans they get up to!) 

Just past the lawn is a garden, where you can walk around and admire the trees, flowers and Grecian sculptures dotted among them. A stone walkway leads to a garden with many succulent plants, fruit trees and benches. 

Montalvo can get pretty busy, especially on weekends, but it still feels like a hidden gem. And on weekday evenings we usually have the entire grounds to ourselves — it’s almost like we really own the place. Sigh. If only we did. Then we could live out our dreams of being rich widows whose husbands died of mysterious causes. 

###Hakone Gardens inspires and transfixes

If Montalvo is like Italy, then Hakone is a little pocket of Japan. We accidentally went to Hakone on one of the busiest days of the year, in early April, loaded up with food because we thought we could have a picnic. 

But unlike Montalvo, which has open grounds for free roaming, Hakone is a tour through the Japanese gardens. So we shoved bagels and fruit into our mouths, cowering awkwardly on a bench to the side of the trail, as other tourists stared at us. When we finished eating, we could finally enjoy everything the gardens had to offer. 

The cherry blossoms were in full bloom, but even in non-spring months, the gardeners skillfully tend to the grounds, which include a small pond with koi fish, a bamboo forest and a number of wisteria-lined pagodas and gazebos.

Because the gardens were so full, we parked on highway 9, but fully blooming cherry blossom trees lined the long trek up and down the hill. These were some of the most beautiful on the grounds, so if you can safely do so, we recommend snapping a couple photos there. 

Even though all three of us squeezed onto a bench for our picnic the bustling morning we went, Hakone’s website says they offer picnic tables for guests. On a regular day, perhaps, if you’re willing to pay a small fee, you can make an afternoon out of picnicking and exploring Japanese gardens right in Saratoga. 

##Saratoga’s hidden upside: productivity

Manasi: In the past, I didn’t particularly like downtown because it just seemed like a boring place full of overpriced restaurants, with nothing interesting for a high schooler. I wished somewhere more exciting was close by. But during college app season, whenever I needed to get out of the house to write (which was often), the only place left open and accessible due to the pandemic was outdoor seating on Big Basin Way, which I finally learned to appreciate. 

My best memories of downtown are when I got free gelato from Big Basin Cafe, or when I got into college and everyone at Sue’s Gallery Cafe yelled congratulations, even though they were all strangers. 

I actually love the size of downtown now — everything feels so warm and cozy, and all the owners and baristas are familiar faces. Unlike other downtown areas, like Los Gatos or Palo Alto, which are huge and full of tourists, here downtown just feels like a sunny extension of home. 

Oftentimes, when I’m tired of sitting in my room, I’ll just head over to my favorite outdoor cafe and end up being much more productive than I was at home. Sometimes, I’ll just sit and read. There’s just something about the peace and crowds of elderly people that allows me to take a breath and truly enjoy how charming Saratoga really is. 

###Vista Arroyo Court: the top of the Valley

Allison: The stereotypical Bay Area student loves viewpoints. So do we, but we don’t necessarily love long, high-altitude, windy roads. That’s the beauty of Vista Arroyo Court: The road is easily accessible, a short drive on Prospect and Parker Ranch and leads to a small view. 

The spot served us well during quarantine days when we bought food to-go but had no place to safely eat it. Armed with a picnic mat and our boxed hummus, we’d make the short trek up the hill and enjoy the view as we ate nearly undisturbed. 

In addition to serving as a picnic spot and great vantage point to experience a sunset or sunrise, Vista Arroyo Court also offers ambitious hikers a short but steep trail. 

While the trail doesn’t have a convenient loop, it’s perfect if you want to get the blood flowing in the morning with a steep climb and watch the sunrise as a reward. 

When I went, some other people seemed to have the same idea, so I stood among a few other families without feeling crowded. This was, of course, important because in the event of a mountain lion sighting, the bar for survival is slightly lower: There’s no need to run fast, just faster than the other people.

###The perfect day in Half Moon Bay

Allison: If you’re looking to get out of the area but not drive for more than an hour, Half Moon Bay is the place to go. There are great hiking trails such as the Cowell-Purisima Coastal Trail, which takes you on a flat hike along the coast and adjacent to some farms, or the Fitzgerald Marine Reserve trail, where you’ll feel small under the many cypress and eucalyptus trees. 

The great thing about Half Moon Bay (and actually the Bay Area in general) is you can go to the beach, walk along a chaparral coast, be in the mountains and hike in the forest all in one day. So I always try to schedule the hike around low tide to see the sea stars and anemones!

Once I’ve worked up an appetite with all that exploring, there are many yummy food options in downtown Half Moon Bay and Capistrano Road.

For lunch, my go-to place is Barbara’s Fishtrap. The Fish ‘n’ Chips burn, no, melt in your mouth because they’re so fresh, and the fries have a perfect potato to crunch ratio. The line can be long, but I can hardly complain with the view of the docks and opportunities for people- and dog-watching.

It’s Italia is a pricer option in downtown Half Moon Bay, but for brunch, lunch or dinner, it’s never failed. Plus, while you're downtown, you can stop at Half Moon Bay Feed & Fuel and look at the cute chicks and rabbits.

Before we go home, we stop at the Pillar Point Harbor and pick up some lobsters or crabs at the docks. Admittedly, I’m not a fan of eating crustaceans, but talking to the friendly boat captains and watching the crabs tangle and disentangle makes the experience worth it.

###Float your boat at Stevens Creek Reservoir 

Allison: A short drive away in Cupertino, Stevens Creek Reservoir is one of my favorite places to kayak. No motorized boats are allowed, so there’s no need to worry about wakes. 

When I kayak there with my dad, we make it our mission to gather as much debris from the reservoir as possible and throw it away. After a couple hours, we end up with anywhere from 20-50 ancient-looking cans, bottles, wrappers and discarded fishing gear.

During droughts, it’s both interesting and sad to see how little water is in the reservoir, but when it’s full, it’s a peaceful place for a picnic or short hike. Plus, there’s always parking.

If you’re not looking to be in the water, I’d suggest taking some food there with a picnic blanket, walking shoes and a couple friends. It’s a short drive (especially if you’re picking up food to-go in Cupertino), and you’ll be rewarded with a peaceful change of scenery.
  
Both of us are staying in the Bay Area for college, so we hope to enjoy all the incredible places here in our next four years. Still, we know that life will get much busier after this summer, and we’re glad that we got a moment of respite this semester to fully appreciate our home.
