When it comes to adopting dogs, it must be a small world.
  Or at least it was for Dylan Li and Josephine Chan.

Dylan first came across his dog Millie, a westie terrier, when he saw photos of her at a pet adoption agency in China. Millie, along with four other dogs, had already been brought to Fremont by a foster parent who decided to put two sibling dogs up for adoption because of a heavy workload. Millie’s brother was Willie, who was adopted by Josephine’s family by sheer coincidence .

To Li’s surprise, his family was able to bring Millie home just one week after seeing her photos. Millie has now been part of the Li family for over a year and is comfortable at home after familiarizing herself with the house and the neighborhood. 

Li said his entire family is grateful to have a new companion to help destress and add excitement into previously monotonous days.

“She is a good way for me and my family to destress by taking her out on walks or playing with her and her toys,” Li said. “It got very boring at home having the same routine every day, and Millie helped change our daily lives.”

Li’s favorite thing about Mille is how she comes running to the door barking to greet him whenever he comes home. 

One of Chou’s favorite activities with Willie is taunting him with treats.

“Once he was refusing to walk, so I dangled a treat in front of him on the way to Argonaut and that got him to follow us,” she said.

By playing with Willie and taking him out on walks, Chou feels similarly about the stress-relieving benefits Willie has brought to her quarantine life for over a year now. In fact, she was shocked how easy it was to take care of a dog as she only needed to feed and walk him.

Li and Chou separately found out about the overseas adoption program through separate friends. The program then introduced them to the foster parent in Fremont, who adopted the dogs directly from China. 

Today, the two dogs meet weekly at Argonaut where they run around together. 

For Chou, the only drawback to getting a dog over quarantine is the fact that she will have spent only a year and a half with Willie before she has to leave for college.

“I just wish I could take my dog to college with me because I know that he'll be lonely when we all go to school,” Chou said.
