In his later years, Albert Einstein reportedly wore some variation of the same outfit every day: a gray suit and a leather jacket. 

If you’ve ever seen me in real life, then you may have noticed that I usually wear some variation of the same outfit every day: a hoodie and sweatpants. 

Now, I won’t say that great minds think alike, but when one of the smartest people in human history and Albert Einstein share similar life decisions, you know there’s something cerebral going on.  

For Einstein, not having to think about what clothes to wear gave him more brainpower to address the important demands of their daily life. 

While that is certainly a factor in my fashion choices — and not something I happened to stumble upon while procrastinating on this column — there are more fundamental reasons I choose to dress like a bum on the daily.

One: It’s convenient. It takes a combined four seconds to put everything on. 

Two: Hoodies and sweatpants are cheap, which means I get to spend my money on other things that make me happy (like food). 

Third, and most importantly — yet a very overlooked aspect when it comes to fashionable clothes — they’re COMFORTABLE. I’ve never found jeans to be comfortable — like, at all. Why are they so tight? And movement restricting? And why are their pockets so bad? 

As a dutiful AP Economics student might put it, I’m just a rational consumer trying to derive maximum utility with my money, and over the years I’ve come to the conclusion that when it comes to clothing, this is the answer.

I suppose another reason I’m able to get away with my outfit choices is that I’m a boy. More specifically, a generic, socially averse Asian male with black hair that attends an academically focused high school — so it’s not like I ever really cared that much about my physical appearance  anyways. 

Of course, there are occasions when I see my (male) friends wear nice outfits and regret my own fashion choices. But three seconds later I forget about it, because we’re all inherently self-absorbed individuals who are too busy worrying about what others think of us to care that much about what clothes everyone else is wearing.

With all this being said, I’m not trying to knock dressing nicely. If that makes you happy, by all means go ahead and do that. You people look great with those aesthetic, vibe-y, matching outfits or whatever. Seriously, you do. 

But for those of you who dress like me, just know that you’re not alone. It might even turn out that you’re making an objectively smarter choice by maximizing your daily brain power. 

Maybe you’ll then go on to use that extra brain power to cure cancer, end climate change, or most glorious of them all, write a column about your poor fashion taste in your school’s senior magazine.
