Dear Principal Louie,

Although at first we were unsure of how our high school life would change because we were getting a new principal at the beginning of junior year, we had nothing to worry about. We knew you were cool when, in your first year as principal, you let students in a Homecoming skit make a joke about how you looked like Wreck-it-Ralph. 

And as soon as you walked on campus, you welcomed us with open arms and the same phrases that had become an integral part of being a Falcon under the leadership of Mr. Paul Robinson: “It’s great to be a Falcon!” and “TOGAther, anything is possible!” 

You observed our classes and supported us at our football games and school musicals, cheering us on even though we had just met. As juniors, we were going through what was allegedly the most difficult year of high school, what with the stress of APs, standardized testing and nearing college applications. But through it all, you were there to support us. 

And then, in March 2020, the pandemic hit. For a year, the campus effectively shut down. You showed to school each day and kept the school moving forward online. You often stayed on campus from sunrise to well after dark dealing with every little thing that makes a school run. Far from Wreck-It-Ralph, you were more like Clark Kent with dozens of superpowers that were hidden on the surface.

Of course, most of us have gone through difficult and confusing times in the past 14 months as our chemistry labs and club meetings all shifted online, sports were postponed and our favorite traditions, like Homecoming and prom, were canceled because of public health orders. 
Despite the changes, you helped alleviate our fears and smooth over the transition. You made videos, worked tirelessly with administrators and teachers to plan for online learning and responded to student emails with encouragement.

And at least one thing stayed consistent: the Friday newsletters. They helped create a sense of community even when we were all so isolated from each other. 

We didn’t have a lot of time in person together, but we are so grateful to have had you as our principal. As we leave, and our younger friends and siblings replace us on campus, we know your dedication will make them proud to be Falcons.
