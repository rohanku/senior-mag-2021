10. Don’t do TikTok dances or whatever idiotic challenges that are trending on that app. You look like a moron and I am sure you will cringe at yourself later. 
9. Nobody cares about your social media. 
8. Second-semester senior year is a lie. Why do teachers assign the same amount of work?
7. Procrastination generates the best work. I procrastinated writing this story. Look at how well it turned out. 
6. Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road has a sheriff’s deputy sitting next to Safeway during lunch at least once a month, ready to ticket highschoolers. Prospect Avenue often has a cop sitting at the Church of the Ascension. Saratoga Avenue has a cop sitting at the Immanuel Lutheran Church and the pumpkin patch sometimes. Don’t ask me why I know that, just thank me later when you have to speed back to class. 
5. (for sophomores) You may think you are prepared for junior year to be difficult, but believe me: You’re not. It will blow your expectations out of the water.
4. (for freshmen) You are inferior to the upperclassmen. It's just a fact. 
3. Don’t ruin good movies during class. I have no idea why people decided to ruin “Saving Private Ryan'' by interrupting D-Day with their idiotic comments.
2. Enjoy online school. You will never be able to mute your teacher again. 
1. Who cares at this point. I’m done writing this story. It's second semester.
