Four years ago, we were starry-eyed freshmen. We had no idea how complex the world around us really was. We had no idea how to collect data, let alone analyze it and share it with others. Most importantly, we had no idea about even the most practical concepts, like that lactic acid was the culprit for our sore legs after hard workouts in P.E., or that the reason our bananas turned all brown and nasty after “forgetting” to eat them for 15 minutes was that oxygen likes to steal electrons.

Four years later, however, we are now well-acquainted with the forces of natures that drive all aspects of life and the intricacies of the scientific method. Through titration labs in chemistry, DNA arts and crafts in biology and hands-on bicycle wheel demos in physics, we learned concepts that will help us beyond high school — and we also had a blast doing so.

In biology, we learned that bacteria can grow exponentially with unlimited resources. Soon after, we learned that our brains could grow exponentially as well, all thanks to the unlimited resources that you provided us, whether it be thought-provoking assignments during class or nurturing support during tutorials. 

Thank you for your energetic lessons and lectures, challenging tests and infinite patience as we awkwardly fumbled through labs with our nonexistent micropipetting skills. Thank you for teaching us how to approach problems analytically and encouraging us to explore the vast unknowns of the universe. And of course, thank you for letting us eat the gummies we used to learn about molecular structure.
