High school has been an emotional rollercoaster, to say the least.

It began with an adrenaline-pumping 400-foot drop of getting demolished by my first test in Mr. Yim’s Precalculus Honors as a freshman, then skyrocketed after not getting demolished by my first test in Ms. Warmuth’s Calculus BC as a sophomore. The ensuing arduous climb to finally getting my drivers’ license was followed by a not-so-adrenaline-pumping plunge when I realized that parking in the crowded junior lot was much harder than I initially imagined.

Still, while I will admit that each year of high school came with its own memorable ups and downs, it’s undeniable that not all years were created equal. And, as a second-semester senior, I’m uniquely qualified to decide which ones are the best and which ones are, well, not ideal. So, why not rank them?

###4. Junior year
It’s probably no surprise that junior year is bringing up the rear. Packed with AP and honors classes, standardized testing, college admissions panic and more AP and honors classes, 11th grade is basically the worst concoction created since the invention of polyjuice potion. The Harry Potter wiki says the potion needs stewed lacewing flies, leeches and shredded Boomslang skin (whatever that is), but junior year is significantly nastier.

The amount of homework was probably the biggest dealbreaker. English 11 Honors homework took hours to finish, sometimes even more when I had an essay or Socratic Seminar prep assigned. AP Chemistry had massive problem sets that were assigned six weeks in advance but due on the day of each unit test, so you can imagine how much time I had to spend the night before the unit test slogging through stoichiometry and calorimetry problems. APUSH readings took hours, at least until I realized I could just watch Jocz Productions’ crash courses on YouTube instead.

I barely had enough time to finish all my homework, extracurricular responsibilities and obligatory 30 minutes of watching YouTube, never mind indulge in the activities I enjoyed. Honestly speaking, the shelter-in-place was my saving grace, giving me a chance to rest and recharge and, of course, reducing my AP exam lengths from 3 hours to 30 minutes. For that, College Board, I thank you. 

And, just because I can’t quite rant enough about the sadness of junior year, I failed my license test my first time with 16 minor errors, just a single error more than the 15-error limit. The second time I managed to get 12 minor errors and, just like everything else in junior year, made it through by the skin of my teeth.

###3. Freshman year
I’m just going to go ahead and say it: Freshman me was awkward. Both socially and emotionally, so tutorial was basically my worst nightmare. I tried doing a lot of things, from speech and debate to robotics to random clubs, but I could not get myself to have somewhat normal human interaction. 

I specifically remember walking by one of the speech and debate captains in the hallway and trying to pretend I didn’t see them so I would not have to say “hi.” To be fair, there is a 25 percent chance I would still do that, but no one can prove it since we’re all online.

Even though my awkwardness is probably single-handedly responsible for freshman year’s placement at second to last on the list, it did not particularly change my enjoyment of the absolute bliss of freshman life. I still enjoyed the absolutely nonexistent homework and equally nonexistent stress that came from having zero responsibilities — which unfortunately changed in later years as I got more involved in student organizations. 

I also very much enjoyed the comment Mr. Yim left on the front cover of my first precalc test after I got an 85 on it. For context, he knew me from the middle school math club, so it seems his expectations were somewhat high.

“Very disappointing. Please ask for help if you need it.” — Mr. Yim 2017.

###2. Senior year
It should be illegal to categorize senior year as a singular entity, but I am going to do just that since the amazingness of second semester is enough to erase the wrongdoings of first semester.

To put it mildly, first semester hurt. Not only was I taking P.E. (which physically hurt), I had to take care of my clubs, deal with fat AP Lang essays and, worst of all, write college essays. I thought college essays would be bad, but they blew my expectations out of the water.

I spent hours staring at blank Google Docs, writing and rewriting the same essay from scratch five times only to realize that I wasn’t answering the prompt and eventually resorting to yelling at the prompts to make themselves easier to answer.

But as soon as winter break rolled around, and I submitted my last few essays, I was free. No essays, no college apps, just absolute and untainted freedom. Well, other than Mr. Abe calling me out every other class over Zoom for not paying attention, it was pure freedom.

I got to spend more time on Quiz Bowl and other competitions I enjoy participating in, and the stress of school and grades completely disappeared. If second semester could have started a bit earlier, senior year would have been my favorite year by far. 

The only downside is that I think I’ve been spending an unhealthy amount of time on YouTube. Is 8 hours a day too much?

###1. Sophomore year
The best way to describe sophomore year is as a perfect combination of second semester senior year and freshman year. No, not because I contracted senioritis in sophomore year (I’m pretty sure I had it long before then), but because I had time to spend on things I enjoyed, very few responsibilities and little homework. Being not completely socially awkward was also a plus.

Unlike in senior year, I had clear goals and expectations for myself. I participated in all kinds of math and science competitions and joined a bunch of clubs. I was insanely productive, basically spending all but an hour each day studying, doing homework or learning new things on Coursera. I never woke up after 9 a.m. on weekends, always slept at 11 p.m. and rarely felt tired even after full days of work. 

Now, I sleep at 11:30 p.m., wake up at 10 a.m. and still somehow end up tired quite literally every day of the week, which is somewhat impressive considering all I do is watch YouTube.

I could probably go on and on about how amazing sophomore year was for me. I liked all my teachers, played JV badminton and got the most exercise I ever would in all four years of high school, performed pretty well in nearly all the competitions I participated in, started my YouTube channel the summer after and still somehow managed to stay on top of all my school stuff.

I even remember having an iconic performance as Cassius in my “Julius Caesar” skit where I stabbed a plastic dagger into a foam block so hard it bent. Most amazingly, I managed to not forget all my lines despite wearing an extremely uncomfortable suit.

Looking back on the twists and turns of high school as I round the final bend of my bumpy roller coaster ride, there seems to be one clear moral of the story. Well, not exactly a moral, but rather an existential question: Is there any way I can have my sophomore self back?
