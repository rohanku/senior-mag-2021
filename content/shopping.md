As I wandered down the aisle with an absurdly large grocery cart and
list written on a sticky note, I wondered how I had been reduced to such
a shameful state: I knew this grocery store by heart, but now I was
scouring the aisles for the small tins of cat food that my cats have
eaten for years.

My mom wasn’t answering my increasingly frantic texts, so all I could do
was speculate how many of the other shoppers noticed I had done three
laps around the same aisle, looking like a wretched puppy.

I’ve been going to the same Safeway my whole life, from a tiny tot
clinging to my mom’s waist and whining for frosted animal cookies to a
defiant preteen running around the store fetching groceries as an errand
girl. So when I was tasked with grocery shopping for my whole family, I
was more than confident I could pull it off.

But like most things that I’ve tried because I’m now legally an “adult,”
it has failed in spectacular fashion.

My exposure to grocery shopping alone started in freshman year, when I
would go on runs from my house to Safeway (terrible idea; Pierce Road
will make roadkill out of you) and then leisurely stroll about the
air-conditioned aisles, picking up a few items that we needed for dinner
or that I required for daily functions.

It wasn’t until I got my license last August that my parents finally
deployed me to go on full-fledged shopping trips. I had heard many tales
about my older sister’s struggles buying groceries for herself as a
college student, and I thought I’d be poised to perhaps succeed at
something she didn’t and feel superior, as well as gain real adult
skills.

When I arrived at Safeway, I felt that my years of tagging along with my
mom would grant me suburban-mom-level knowledge of sale prices and
arcane knowledge about where to find items like cornstarch or
half-and-half. But this feeling lasted for approximately the time it
took me to get to the produce section and realize I didn’t know the
difference between yellow and white onions — roughly 2 minutes.

You might think the grocery store is organized in a way to maximize
convenience for shoppers, but they failed to realize that chronic
overthinkers like me would make everything more complicated. Between
comparing sale prices, debating which package of green beans would be
the right portion for dinner and passing over the item I need because
I’m looking too hard for it, I would be considered lucky to spend 40
minutes at the store.

Chronicling all of this, I have actually picked up on a few tips that
may make your own grocery shopping experience less pathetic than my own.

-   Make a list, and make it specific: It may seem pretty obvious, but I
bet you’re going to thank me when you don’t have to call your mom
in the dairy section because you don’t remember what yogurt brand
she likes.

-   Start at one side of the store and work your way to the other side:
This way, you don’t have to push your cart back and forth and look
like a total amatuer.

-   Find sale prices: Another intuitive one, but don’t underestimate the
power of “buy two, get one free” promotions.

-   Double check your list before checking out: Then triple check it.
Believe me, you don’t want to be put in the position of running
across the store when you’re in the middle of checking out,
invariably being silently judged by fellow shoppers — it’s
shameful.

So maybe I won’t be heading off to school with the refined shopping
skills that I thought I’d be able to flex to my peers when we inevitably
need to prepare actual meals. Yet I’ve definitely gained some tricks
that may qualify me for a field guide position when we must navigate
whatever harrowing aisles await us. But whatever happens, please don’t
ask me where the cornstarch is — I still don’t know.
