In our busy lives, we’re constantly worrying about the now and how the now will impact the future. Will not working out now make me chubby in the future? Will watching YouTube now ruin my chances of finishing an English project? Will eating a banana now make me radioactive? Well, maybe not the last one.

But history teachers, for the past four years, you have provided us a needed reprieve from our focus on the now with important reflections on both the distant and not-so-distant past — from lessons on how World War I and II shaped the current global power landscape to reflections on slavery and its legacy in the U.S.

You’ve taught us how, as George Santayana put it, those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. Together, we dived into the past to explain the present and learn from the painful mistakes of history — from the oppressive rule of the British monarchy over its colonies to the plethora of factors that allowed for a murderous autocrat like Hitler to nearly conquer all of Europe. You helped us understand the measures in place to prevent these violations, from our sacred First Amendment rights to a system of checks and balances that prevents any one branch from gaining dictatorial powers.

Most importantly, you’ve taught us how to think critically about the information we consume, both by analyzing the author’s interests and finding multiple perspectives. As much as we may have complained about dreaded DBQ packets, you’ve taught us one of the most important skills we will ever need — to not take everything we hear at face value. Whether it be lateral reading or source verification, we have learned ways to identify and avoid fake news and synthesize our own understanding of complex issues from the past, present and future.

Through debates on the dropping of the atomic bomb, monthly jeopardy reviews and historically relevant films on D-Day and women’s suffrage, you’ve taught us all these things and more in an entertaining and effective way. 

Thank you for your patience with us as we found the maturity to discuss difficult political topics. Thank you for your guidance through some of the most difficult classes we’ve taken in our high school careers (especially AP U.S. History). And of course, thank you for leaving us with the skills we need to write our own histories as we venture off to college.
