On game days in regular years, you might have crossed paths with Berry Bailey, Iris Lee, Jane Loo, Athena Mahajani and Kaitlyn Yu multiple times during a single tutorial. On some days, their girls’ basketball hoodies and sweatpants matched, and on game days the chance of matching gear was even greater. 

Sometimes a passerby might have even heard their conversation before seeing the squad: Passionate discussions about favorite Marvel characters, difficult classes and basketball arguments inevitably flared up. Even so, tensions quickly faded among this tight-knit group.

Iris, Athena, Jane and Kaitlyn first bonded in sixth grade through the Redwood Middle School girls’ basketball team and outside club teams. Since then, Iris, Kaitlyn and Jane have played seven seasons together, excluding club teams. In freshman year, Berry joined the squad.

When he met them that year, former girls’ basketball coach Danny Wallace recognized their potential, even as “scared freshmen.” 

“They were very hyper and full of energy, which was great because you could tell they wanted to be here,” he said.

The hours of basketball practices, weightlifting workouts, camps and eating out together drew them close, but Iris said they would have been friends without basketball — well, maybe not Berry, Iris and Athena added in unison. Berry confirmed, since she probably wouldn’t have met them without basketball.

“All of us have similar interests,” Jane said. “With me, Iris and Athena, we can do adventurous things that other kids don’t like to do or watch shows we thought were cool, but a bunch of other people hated.”

Their banter about who would have actually been friends with who without basketball characterized the honesty in their friendship and teammate dynamic. They didn’t disguise recounts of bad impressions (Athena was “a complete ball hog,” according to Berry) and gave honest assessments of each other’s performance. 

Jane, who tore her ACL in junior year, would “keep it real” from the sidelines, congratulating Berry on rebounds and good games or pointing out areas for improvement.

During the basketball season, competitiveness could run high. In some instances, teammates were pitted against each other for spots on the team or starting positions, Berry said.

“Sometimes we hate each other for no reason,” Iris said, but added the team still loves and supports each other in the end. 

Take basketball out of the equation, and the group’s dynamic is more relaxed. After being heated about basketball-related things, Jane said hanging out with the group as friends has always been refreshing. 

Wallace said his favorite memory of the squad was their sophomore season, when they were the underdogs in the CCS quarterfinals against Mills High School. 

“We went to their gym and just out-played Mills every minute of the game,” Wallace said. “Seeing how happy they all were with their team is just a priceless moment.”

The team went to CCS in their freshman, sophomore and junior years, but since this year’s season is unofficial because of the pandemic, CCS didn’t occur. This season, a new head coach, Jaclyn Brode, led the team. Although the team had a rough start, they caught up to teams that practiced throughout the pandemic and built chemistry with each other.

The departing squad will miss playing together and traditions like eating three donuts before a Concord tournament game, but they’ll remember their past antics, like provoking noise complaints and stealing Jane’s crutches.

“Once in junior year, I just got injured, so I didn't have to sleep early for the game,” Jane said.  “So Iris and I stayed up until 5 a.m., doing magic tricks and watching YouTube. Athena tried to stay up, but then she got knocked out at one, and then Iris just took photos of her in different sleeping positions while doing magic and watching YouTube.” 

While the lack of sleep didn’t affect sidelined Jane, Iris said she felt like she “died the next game.”

Their only regrets are half-baked: While basketball was time-consuming, it helped them bond, stay in shape, and improve on and off the court. Having completed nearly four seasons of high school basketball, they also wish they could tell their younger selves to not let their passion for the game make them too intense. 

And, in their classic way, they ended the conversation with cheeky banter about who would actually be friends with who after graduation. Yet despite Berry’s declaration that they wouldn’t be friends, nobody would be surprised if the four never lose their chemistry and always stay in touch.
