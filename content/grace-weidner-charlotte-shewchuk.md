For Grace Weidner, art means sitting in front of a canvas, her oil paints next to her and her mind filled with questions about society. For Charlotte Shewchuk, art is about working on her iPad to create fan art from her favorite shows and musicals. 

Regardless of their different mediums and styles, both seniors share an interest in creating and selling art pieces.

###Grace Weidner

Grace has been working with oil paints for four years now and has been using other mediums such as gouache and watercolor for even longer. At the onset of the pandemic, she began selling her pieces online.

  She recalls feeling “powerless” and wanting to help others despite the shelter-in-place. Thus, she decided to sell her original prints and open commissions, and donate part of her profits to organizations working with foster children. 

Grace plans to pursue a career in art, including going to art school and believes that selling art would benefit her in the long term as well. 

“I am eventually going to have to do it full time so I wanted to learn how to navigate the business element of it early on,” Weidner said. 

Grace’s artistic focus is portraiture and figure painting. She primarily sells through her Instagram account, with a sliding price scale for commissions typically between $50 to $70 depending on the medium, and her prints selling for $20. For commissions, Grace said customers are often familiar with her art and ask her to paint portraits of themselves or loved ones. 

Even though she can charge more for commissions, Grace prefers to sell her own designs. 

“I create art for me, so the thought that a drawing I made that felt true and real to me also means something to others is really validating emotionally,” she said. “I want to pose questions about life and society in my works, as well as about intimacy and identity that I have not yet been able to express in commission work.” 

Although Grace recognizes the benefits of digital art and has dabbled in it more recently, she said she still prefers traditional mediums. 

Grace noted that she often finds herself struggling with motivation while working on commissioned pieces due to the limitations on her creative freedom, often having to force herself to sit down and complete it. However, she plans to continue commissions until she can make a larger profit from her originals. 

Despite the limitations, Grace said she has learned a lot from running her own art business, most notably the importance of clear communication with customers and working through any misunderstandings. 

“Just knowing I can handle the whole process [of selling art] has been really good for my self-esteem, and when people enjoy what I made for them, I like to see them happy,” she said.

###Charlotte Shewchuk 

On the other hand, Charlotte has been selling her art since freshman year. She started off making her pieces in her sketchbook and uploading images to RedBubble, an online shop where users can share and sell their work.

“I started selling them just to see if I could,” she said. “I really liked some of the designs I made so I thought I would give it a shot.”

Charlotte switched the majority of her sales to Etsy after a year of using RedBubble, feeling that “the profit margins were very slim and there were a lot more regulations and outside control” on RedBubble. 

As time went on and she learned more about other mediums, she made the transition to digital art first with MediBang and later with ProCreate, a more sophisticated drawing program. Charlotte prefers to use digital art when bringing her creations to life, noting that “it’s really easy to scale the designs properly and ensures that the images are always clear and high resolution.”

Though Charlotte also offers commissions, she says the bulk of her sales come from her original artwork, including pinback buttons, stickers, and prints that she has posted on Etsy. Charlotte’s work is mostly fan art inspired by popular musicals like “Be More Chill” and “Heathers” and anime like “My Hero Academia” and “Haikyuu!!”, though she sells other art not necessarily related to any fandom. 

“My most popular design on Etsy is a communist frog that I originally made as a joke but people really took a liking to it,” Charlotte said. 

She said that over her four years of selling art, she has gained insight on what types of pieces she should prioritize in order to satisfy customers, while still creating time to make pieces for herself. 

"I’ve had products I made as a joke become best sellers while products I thought would do great only get a few sales,” Charlotte said. “Now, I prioritize making the products I know will get those sales and start making products that fall into similar categories."
